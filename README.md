RTS Virtual Lieutenant

New!!!
Strategy Guide for newbies -- There's some information in this guide that even some vets may not have known! This includes information on how to play the game, how to attack and defend, how to cooperate within an alliance, what each building in your city does, the importance of wilds (and wild flipping), a brief introduction to Heroes and how they work, and so much more!!! This is totally worth it for you Newbies out there!!!

----------

This application is meant for Kabam users of games such as Arcane Empires, Kingdoms of Camelot, or The Hobbit: Kingdoms of Middle Earth. 

Have you ever been frustrated with Kabam's bookmarking system? Don't you think it sucks that your bookmarked coordinates can't be searched based on might, coordinate location, username, or alliance? Wouldn't it be awesome to have one place to store all of these things in a quick and easy to locate place?

Gamers, your voices have been heard and an answer is here. Download the Real Time Strategy game Virtual Lieutenant and have all of this and more at your finger tips. There's even a Personal hit list that allows you to keep track of all of the gamers who have royally pissed you off--completely separate from the general enemy coordinates. You can even store aggression level of your enemies, from Totally Non-Threatening to Total Douchebag. 

Coming Soon -- 
1. Ability to share your coordinate list with your alliance.
2. Personal Growth Tracker to track how you are progressing through the game week by week (including resource generation, might growth, and TK's).

(Updates won't necessarily be in this order)


Please Note: THIS IS IN NO WAY AFFILIATED WITH KABAM OR IT'S SUBSIDARIES.
