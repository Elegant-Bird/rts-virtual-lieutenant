They don't share this with you in game but your Barracks are useful for more than just training higher levels of troops. Remember that you only need between five and seven houses. With that, you should have no less than ten Barracks. Level all of them up to a level nine. The more Barracks you have, the faster you can train troops. Don't believe me? Try it for yourself.
