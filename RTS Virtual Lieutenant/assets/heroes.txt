I'm going to make this as plain as possible--after a certain point of attacking cities, you simply cannot reach a level 200 hero from attacking cities and wilds alone. Here is how experience points work

	1) Your hero earns 20 EXP for every successful attack/defense
	2) Your hero earns 10 EXP for every failed attack/defense

Grab some mithril (yes it costs money) and train your hero with Gandalf, or even archers, or warriors. Whatever. Just train them. Sometimes you get lucky in Gollum's game of Chance and you can win a few Train with Gandalf's. Keep an eye out for those World Competitions, you can win some pretty cool stuff to help you out with your hero.
