Many people ask what the big deal about having a second city is. 

Others ask what do they do once they have their second city. 

Well, here's some advice. 

1. Keep most of your troops at one city, and make that the city where you develop your Stone, Wood, and Ore.

2. Leave your second city with only some paltry troops (No more than 20K Upkeep) and raise mostly Farms so that you can self-sustain yourself with food. 

You can send resources back and forth between your cities just like you can share with your alliance members. So, when one city needs wood, stone, or ore, you can send that over. The reverse works for the food. That way you have a fairly even amount of resource generation. 

Trying to play the game with only one city is a nightmare--your troops will eat up all of your food faster than you can say "Where did it go!?" Building a second city is definitely a good idea, and if you're a serious gamer, go for that third city if it's available on your Server. It can only help you. 

Seriously. 

Now, the awesome thing about having multiple cities is that, even though you have to start building physical buildings from the ground up, the Research is shared. This means you can research 2 different topics in your cities and have it apply across all of them. Good stuff, right?

Not only that, you can train troops in all of your cities. So, if you have ten barracks in 2 cities, you can have queues of 20 (10 in one city, 10 in the other). That means you can double the might in half the time! 

So, go and splurge and buy yourself a second/third city and enjoy the rewards. It's well worth it!
