This is a sore subject for most people, so I'm going to try to be as impartial about this as possible (which isn't much at all, so don't hold your breath). 

First, let me explain what Wild Flipping is, because people tend to be very confused. Okay, so say you see a nice level 9 wild that you want for yourself and you send a single soldier in and steal it from someone else. That, is wild STEALING. Go for it. It'll piss people off and probably make them come after you, but there's nothing wrong with it. 

Wild FLIPPING is when you take someone's wild, and then immediately abandon it. (Please note that this makes you a supreme douchebag). Now, while you might be a jerk to pull a move like this, I will concede that it is a great war strategy. Nothing will make someone come after you faster than flipping their wild. 

Why? 

Well, first of all, wilds are useful as hell in that they increase resource production. But that's not the issue. The issue is that someone lost a lot of troops to attain that wild, and now that you've abandoned it, they can't simply take it back from you with a few troops. They have to lose another 20K might or more for it. And that's annoying as Gollum trying to steal your damn ring again. 

Now, if you really want to lure someone into a trap, say your alliance has beef with this guy and you set up your city with a ton of reins in hopes that he will attack. If you provoke him by taking his wild, he'll come after you in full force and you just might be able to knock him down a few pegs with all those reins you have. 

But again, it's a douchebag move. Your call, though.
