Some people actually try to attack goblin camps and earn 100 relics for that second city. This is folly. Complete and utter folly. My advice? If you really care about this game that much, drop the $20 and just buy the deed. I'll tell you my rationale behind this. 

	1) Only goblin camps level 6 and higher drop relics. This means that you're probably going to lose at least 15K might for every high level goblin camp you attack. Keep in mind you need 100 of these relics
	
	2) They do NOT always drop relics. So, you attack a level 9 goblin camp, lose 10K troops, and end up with nothing more to show for it then 30K wood resources. It's a complete waste of troops
	
	3) Even if you were determined enough to do this, you seriously have to consider that it really is 100 relics. Which means you are probably going to have to attack a minimum of 200 goblin camps to get all of the relics for it. So let's do the math. Assume a level 6 goblin camp (the minimum for relics) will kill about 10k Tier 1 troops. That's 40,000 Might. Multiply that by 200 (the minimum number of camps you'll have to attack for 100 relics). That's 8 MILLION MIGHT. Most people who have played the game for MONTHS have never even seen half that much might. 
	
Conclusion? 

Spend the 20 bucks. It's really not that bad. Worse comes to worst, ask a relative to give you an iTunes or Google Play gift card for your birthday or designated religious holiday. It's worth it, I assure you. Most people with only one city stop playing after a month or so. It simply becomes too hard to keep up.
