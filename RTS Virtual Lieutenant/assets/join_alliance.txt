This is mostly directed to the newbies out there -- Don't rush to go and join an alliance. 

Honestly? Enjoy your freedom, especially while you have that protective little bubble over you for 7 days. Go into the global chat and get to know some people, see who you like and who you might want to be in a brother/sister-hood with. It makes all the difference, because you actually want to spend some time with these people in Alliance Chat. 

Picking an alliance is a serious thing, and you want to make sure you have the best fit.

Now, for those of you level 3's out there with 0 Might.... STOP TRYING TO BEG PEOPLE TO ACCEPT YOU!!! You are young and weak, and it's not your fault. Build up first! Make yourself attractive to these strong alliances and level up. I you're not at least a level 12 in that first week, you probably don't even play the game enough to need an alliance. 

Give it time, and be patient!
