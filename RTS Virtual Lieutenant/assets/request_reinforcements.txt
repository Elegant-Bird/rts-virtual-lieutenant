Please try not to run to the alliance chat and beg for reinforcements the minute you see an attack. Do your research first!!! When an attack is coming, follow the steps I laid out in "Defending your City" first. THEN you can request reins. If you request reins when there's only a team of porters coming, you look very foolish. 

Also, remember that reinforcements eat YOUR food! Your upkeep goes up the moment the reins arrive, and the reins will only leave when your alliance member recalls his/her troops. Be mindful of this!!!
