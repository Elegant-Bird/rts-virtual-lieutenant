This is where I get the most questions from noobs. How do I attack a city? I'll go through some very rudimentary instructions and, in time, you'll decide what the best strategy is (I hope). 

Okay, so you've gone to the map and you found a nice little city that only has roughly 13,000 Might. You have a lofty 30,000 might (woohoo, go you!!) and you think you can take them. Instead of going in guns blazing (because you have no idea what you are doing) you send a Scout in first. 

... (this is me waiting the standard 30 seconds for your scout to come back) ...
... still waiting ...
... are we done yet?

Okay, you scouted and you see that they have 1,000 Militia and 1,000 Archers and 1,000 Mounted. Not only that, since you researched Far Seeing like a good Hobbit, you know that their Vault is only a level 1 but they have 300,000 if each resource. That's 200,000 too much! 

You also see that they have some wall fortifications (which, as we covered earlier, is a horrible idea. Do NOT build walls. How many times must I say that? You're just making yourself a big red target for people who want to get their TK ranking up. Like me). Now, before you go thinking, "I can destroy those walls, no big," let's see if they are defending with their actual troops, shall we? 

Send your lowest level hero in there with a porter, or cart, or wagon, to see if it's only their walls defending the city. If that's the case, take a look at the wall. If it's a 300 Traps, go to your own City Wall and take a look at what Traps are weak against. Aha! Traps are useless v. Mounted troops. So, send in a few thousand of your lovely Mounted soldiers and take those walls out! Don't forget to send in some porters, or carts, or wagons (always send the best you have. Again, porters suck), so that you can take home all of those lovely extra resources they have. 

Look at that! You made your first attack. Congratulations!!
