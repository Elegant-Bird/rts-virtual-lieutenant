Resources are fairly unlimited as far as the game goes--you can find more pretty much anywhere. The issue comes when people request resources without farming first. That is very bad, and many alliances will kick you out for it. Don't know what farming is? 

Farming - the act of attacking another city for the sake of stealing their resources for your own. 

So, farm my friends. Farm your heart out. No one plays this game to be the best hugger (don't know what a hugger is? Let's put it this way, if you're not farming, you're a hugger. If you run away from a city because they have a few soldiers defending it, you're a hugger). Hey, if you want to be the best hugger in the game, go for it, just don't expect people to love you.
